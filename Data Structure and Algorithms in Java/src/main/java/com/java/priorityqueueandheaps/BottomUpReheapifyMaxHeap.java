*BottomUpReheapifyMaxHeap
- A Max heap is a complete binary tree in which each node value is >= than the values of its children
- After inserting an element into heap. It may not satisfy above heap property. This, we perform bottom-up
Reheapify technique, in which we adjust the locations of elements to satisfy heap property,

*Max Binary Heap
- A Max heap is a complete binary tree in which each node value is >= than the values of its children.
- The Maximum value is at the top which is root of complete binary tree. For its array representation its at index 1 heap[1] 23`q2
